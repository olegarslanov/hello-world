# hello-world
This repository is for practicing with EPAM

Hi, my name is Oleg. I am 46 years old, and I want to change my career path to work in IT.

When I was younger, teachers and professors sometimes told me that I had a talent for mathematics, but I didn't pay much attention to that at the time. Now, I realize that I could have been a good mathematician, but time has passed. However, I believe that coding, in many ways, is also about math.

I hope to successfully complete this course with good results and land a job at EPAM.
